    <meta name="description" content="Lucifer : Translation of הֵילֵל as &quot;Lucifer&quot;, as in the King James Version, has been abandoned in modern English translations of Isaiah 14:12. Present-day translations have &quot;morning star&quot; (New International Version, New Century Version, New American Standard Bible, Good News Translation, Holman Christian Standard Bible, Contemporary English Version, Common English Bible, Complete Jewish Bible), &quot;daystar&quot; (New Jerusalem Bible, English Standard Version, The Message), &quot;shining one&quot; (New Life Version) or &quot;shining star&quot; (New Living Translation). The term appears in the context of an oracle against a dead king of Babylon,[17] who is addressed as הילל בן שחר (hêlêl ben šāḥar),[18][19][20][need quotation to verify] [21][need quotation to verify] rendered by the King James Version as &quot;O Lucifer, son of the morning!&quot; and by others as &quot;morning star, son of the dawn&quot;. In a modern translation from the original Hebrew, the passage in which the phrase &quot;Lucifer&quot; or &quot;morning star&quot; occurs begins with the statement: &quot;On the day the Lord gives you relief from your suffering and turmoil and from the harsh labour forced on you, you will take up this taunt against the king of Babylon: How the oppressor has come to an end! How his fury has ended!&quot;[22] After describing the death of the king, the taunt continues: &quot;How you have fallen from heaven, morning star, son of the dawn! You have been cast down to the earth, you who once laid low the nations! You said in your heart, 'I will ascend to the heavens; I will raise my throne above the stars of God; I will sit enthroned on the mount of assembly, on the utmost heights of Mount Zaphon. I will ascend above the tops of the clouds; I will make myself like the Most High.' But you are brought down to the realm of the dead, to the depths of the pit. Those who see you stare at you, they ponder your fate: 'Is this the man who shook the earth and made kingdoms tremble, the man who made the world a wilderness, who overthrew its cities and would not let his captives go home?'&quot;[23] J. Carl Laney has pointed out that in the final verses here quoted, the king of Babylon is described not as a god or an angel but as a man.[24][25] For the unnamed[26] &quot;king of Babylon&quot; a wide range of identifications have been proposed.[27] They include a Babylonian ruler of the prophet Isaiah's own time[27] the later Nebuchadnezzar II, under whom the Babylonian captivity of the Jews began, or Nabonidus,[27][28] and the Assyrian kings Tiglath-Pileser, Sargon II and Sennacherib.[24][27][29] Herbert Wolf held that the &quot;king of Babylon&quot; was not a specific ruler but a generic representation of the whole line of rulers.[30]" />

<a name="welcome-to-github-pages" class="anchor" href="#welcome-to-github-pages"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Welcome to GitHub Pages.</h3>

<p>This automatic page generator is the easiest way to create beautiful pages for all of your projects. Author your page content here using GitHub Flavored Markdown, select a template crafted by a designer, and publish. After your page is generated, you can check out the new branch:</p>

<pre><code>$ cd your_repo_root/repo_name
$ git fetch origin
$ git checkout gh-pages
</code></pre>

<p>If you're using the GitHub for Mac, simply sync your repository and you'll see the new branch.</p>

<h3>
<a name="designer-templates" class="anchor" href="#designer-templates"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Designer Templates</h3>

<p>We've crafted some handsome templates for you to use. Go ahead and continue to layouts to browse through them. You can easily go back to edit your page before publishing. After publishing your page, you can revisit the page generator and switch to another theme. Your Page content will be preserved if it remained markdown format.</p>

<a name="rather-drive-stick" class="anchor" href="#rather-drive-stick"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Rather Drive Stick?</h3>

<p>If you prefer to not use the automatic generator, push a branch named <code>gh-pages</code> to your repository to create a page manually. In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple, blog aware static site generator written by our own Tom Preston-Werner. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features.</p>

<h3>
<a name="authors-and-contributors" class="anchor" href="#authors-and-contributors"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Authors and Contributors</h3>

<p>You can <a href="https://github.com/blog/821" class="user-mention">@mention</a> a GitHub username to generate a link to their profile. The resulting <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> element will link to the contributor's GitHub Profile. For example: In 2007, Chris Wanstrath (<a href="https://github.com/defunkt" class="user-mention">@defunkt</a>), PJ Hyett (<a href="https://github.com/pjhyett" class="user-mention">@pjhyett</a>), and Tom Preston-Werner (<a href="https://github.com/mojombo" class="user-mention">@mojombo</a>) founded GitHub.</p>
